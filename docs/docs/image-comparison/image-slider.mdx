# Image Comparison Component

The `<image-comparison>` component is an interactive element that allows users to compare two images side-by-side using a slider. It's perfect for before-and-after comparisons or any scenario where visual differences between two images need to be highlighted.

## Installation

To use the `<image-comparison>` component, ensure you have installed the `essential-components` package in your project.

```bash
npm install essential-components
```

## Import

Import the component in your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```javascript
import 'essential-components/src/image-comparison';
```

## Usage/Examples

After importing, you can use the `<image-comparison>` component in your HTML or JSX. Place two `<img>` elements inside the component, using the `slot` attribute to specify which image is which.

```html
<image-comparison thumb-color="#000">
  <img slot="image1" src="./img/japan-2011-after.jpg" alt="Japan after 2011">
  <img slot="image2" src="./img/japan-2011-before.jpg" alt="Japan before 2011">
</image-comparison>
```

<EssentialImage/>

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `thumb-color` | String | The color of the slider thumb. Use any valid CSS color value. | No | `"#fff"` |

## Slots

| Slot Name | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `image1` | The first image to be compared (typically the "after" image). | Yes |
| `image2` | The second image to be compared (typically the "before" image). | Yes |

## Behavior

The component displays two images overlaid on each other. A vertical slider separates the images, allowing users to drag left or right to reveal more of one image or the other. The `image1` slot is displayed on the right side of the slider, while `image2` is on the left.

## Styling

The `<image-comparison>` component comes with built-in styles for the slider functionality. You can further customize its appearance using CSS custom properties or by styling the containing element.

## Browser Support

This component should work in all modern browsers that support [Custom Elements](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1) and [Shadow DOM](https://caniuse.com/shadowdomv1).

## Accessibility

Consider the following accessibility implications when using this component:

- Ensure that both images have meaningful `alt` text to describe their content.
- The slider should be operable via keyboard controls (verify this functionality).
- Consider adding ARIA attributes if necessary to improve screen reader compatibility.

## Performance

The `<image-comparison>` component is designed to be lightweight, but be mindful of the image sizes used. Large images may impact load times and smooth slider interactions.

## Best Practices

1. Use images of the same dimensions for the best comparison effect.
2. Ensure the images are properly aligned to make the comparison meaningful.
3. Choose a `thumb-color` that contrasts well with both images for better visibility.
